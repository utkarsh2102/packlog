## packlog: Log your Packets! \o/

`packlog` is a simple kernel module which will log all your incoming packets, one-by-one. What for? Nothing, but fun!  
With this, you can see how many packets are being transferred when you make a simple HTTP(S) request, or even otherwise.

### Compiling

Well, we use `make` for compiling, so that's something your system should have.  
Maybe you'll also need the `build-essential` package, which is readily available to install via your package manager.

- So, clone the repository:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/utkarsh2102/packlog
    ```

- Run make to compile the source.
    ```bash
    $ make
    ```

And there you go! Done!  
You'll see a bunch of binaries and files generated by this. And the only thing we're interested in is `packlog.ko`.

From [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10477109),
> The **.ko** file is your object file linked with some kernel automatically generated data structures that are needed by the kernel.

### Using

Now since we have `packlog.ko` ready, let's use it!

- Insert the compiled kernel module:
    ```bash
    $ sudo insmod packlog.ko
    ```

- Now that the module is intialized, let's see the incoming packets:
    ```bash
    $ sudo dmesg | tail
    ```

- At this point, you'll see some packets already have started to get logged. Let's make a HTTP request now and see what happens. Open Firefox and open any site, or type the following in another terminal:
    ```bash
    $ firefox utkarsh2102.com
    ```
    You'll see a spike in the number of packets. Obviously, eh? But fun, isn't it? But can you guess why the number of packets keep increasing? Which packets are these? Any idea? ^.^

- Anyway, now that fun time's over, let's remove the inserted module:
    ```bash
    $ sudo rmmod packlog
    ```

- Finally, check the `dmesg` logs to ensure that the module has been removed:
    ```bash
    $ sudo dmesg | tail
    ```
