## packlog: Log your Packets! \o/

`packlog` is a simple kernel module which will log all your incoming packets, one-by-one. What for? Nothing, but fun!  
With this, you can see how many packets are being transferred when you make a simple HTTP(S) request, or even otherwise.


### Compiling

Well, we use `make` for compiling, so that's something your system should have.  
Maybe you'll also need the `build-essential` package, which is readily available to install via your package manager.

- So, clone the repository:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/utkarsh2102/packlog
    ```

- Run make to compile the source.
    ```bash
    $ make
    ```

And there you go! Done!  
You'll see a bunch of binaries and files generated by this. And the only thing we're interested in is `packlog.ko`.

> The **.ko** file is your object file linked with some kernel automatically generated data structures that are needed by the kernel.
